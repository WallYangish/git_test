    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <p>
      What's up bitches? I'm making poor life choices like thinking I can get a
      job coding. Funny, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Honestly not the worst idea I've had in the past couple of years. Or
      months. Or days. Or....
    </p>
    <p>
      Without further adieu, let's get started on learning about ordered and
      unordered lists.
    </p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <h4>Undordered Lists</h4>

    <p>Unordered lists have to be</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Done within paragraph</li>
      <li>Use UL for "unlisted"</li>
      <li>
        Used for things that don't have to be listed in a particuluar order
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      With these parameters in place, a list with bullet points is created. Good
      for things like shopping lists, general to-do lists, and I'm sure some
      other stuff
    </p>

    <h4>Ordered Lists</h4>

    <p>Ordered lists are practically the same as unordered but you have to</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use the OL tag instead of UL</li>
      <li>
        Type out the list remembering to list things with LI nested within the
        OL tags
      </li>
      <li>Think of more things to write to fill out the list</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      This will appear similarly to unordered lists, but now instead of bullet
      points we are presented with a numbered list.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think it's time to take a break. I've actually learned some HTML this
      evening, and the layout of it all makes sense. Logic=good.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, I really do
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfG9SYKg0V0&feature=youtu.be"
        >feel like this</a
      >
    </p>

    <h2>Links</h2>

    <p>
      Links start with an anchor element, with ,a. . This is the clickable text,
      like how "feel like this" is above. This is great but useless without an
      href attribute. This will be inserted before the end carrot on a. ,a href=
      link name. , then the text, and then the ,/a, .
    </p>

    <h3>Absolute Links</h3>

    <p>
      An absolute link is one that links to other parts of the internet
      <em>outside</em> of the page you're on.
