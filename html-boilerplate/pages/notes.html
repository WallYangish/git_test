    <h1>Hello World!</h1>

    <h5>Want to get back to the <a href="../index.html">Homepage?</a></h5>

    <p>
      What's up bitches? I'm making poor life choices like thinking I can get a
      job coding. Funny, right?
    </p>
    <p>
      Honestly not the worst idea I've had in the past couple of years. Or
      months. Or days. Or....
    </p>
    <p>
      Without further adieu, let's get started on learning about ordered and
      unordered lists.
    </p>

    <h2>Lists</h2>

    <h4>Undordered Lists</h4>

    <p>Unordered lists have to be</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Done within paragraph</li>
      <li>Use UL for "unlisted"</li>
      <li>
        Used for things that don't have to be listed in a particuluar order
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      With these parameters in place, a list with bullet points is created. Good
      for things like shopping lists, general to-do lists, and I'm sure some
      other stuff
    </p>

    <h4>Ordered Lists</h4>

    <p>Ordered lists are practically the same as unordered but you have to</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use the OL tag instead of UL</li>
      <li>
        Type out the list remembering to list things with LI nested within the
        OL tags
      </li>
      <li>Think of more things to write to fill out the list</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      This will appear similarly to unordered lists, but now instead of bullet
      points we are presented with a numbered list.
    </p>

    <p>
      I think it's time to take a break. I've actually learned some HTML this
      evening, and the layout of it all makes sense. Logic=good.
    </p>

    <p>
      Still, I really do
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfG9SYKg0V0&feature=youtu.be"
        >feel like this</a
      >
    </p>

    <h2>Links</h2>

    <p>
      Links start with an anchor element, with ,a. . This is the clickable text,
      like how "feel like this" is above. This is great but useless without an
      href attribute. This will be inserted before the end carrot on a. ,a href=
      link name. , then the text, and then the ,/a, .
    </p>

    <h4>Absolute Links</h4>

    <p>
      An absolute link is one that links to other parts of the internet
      <em>outside</em> of the page you're on, like how the link above labeled as
      "feel like this" routes you to the Alex Jones video saying how retarded he
      is (pretty retarded is the answer)
    </p>

    <h4>Relative Links</h4>

    <p>
      Relative links go to pages that are within the site being browsed. The
      first example of this shown to do in TOP is an
      <strong><a href="about.html">About Page</a>.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      What I just learned is that the filepath you give this in the href will
      pull from the same directory, so in order to organize your files better
      within other directories, you can putcod the new directory and file name
      and it won't be a broken link. This makes sense to me, and that's all that
      matters. Coding journaling lol.
    </p>

    <h2>Images</h2>

    <p>
      Images are placed using the img element, wherein you use src= follwed by
      the file name. Same as the other stuff, if you need to include any parent
      directories you can.
    </p>

    <h4>Alt Attribute</h4>

    <p>
      Alt attributes can be asdded to describe the image, which helps screen
      readers. These seem to be added easily by doing alt= after the quotation
      marks that wrap around the source location. I'm not sure if it does
      anything for regular browsing or just screen readers, but I'm going to add
      something to it now and see how it goes. Wish me luck :~)
    </p>

    <h2>CSS Begins!</h2>

    <p>
      Well it's that time. Recipe project has finished so now it's on to the CSS
      foundations module. I'm going to continue taking notes on this stuff,
      likely, and will be posting it through the link below. Hopefully we'll
      soon be living in backgrounds and borders and divs and elements and
      whatever the hell else there is to learn about
    </p>
